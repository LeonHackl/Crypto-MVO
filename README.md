# Mean-Variance-Optimization in the Era of Financial Digitalization
Consider an asset universe consisting of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK) and the Binance Coin (BNB). We want to find the optimal portfolio X, consisting of these different cryptocurrencies/tokens. Based on the Mean-Variance-Optimization (MVO) framework introduced by Markowitz in 1952, we'll use different optimization algorithms in order to find the best portfolio.
